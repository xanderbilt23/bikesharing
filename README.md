# Bike Trip Analysis
## Overview 
Used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, used the converted datatype, to create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results 
![Checkout Times for Users]()
Number of bikes vs. tripduration in minutes. Most trips are less than 10 minutes. 

![Checkout Times by Gender]()
There doesn't seem to be a correlation with gender vs tripduration. Most of the tripdurations are short. 

![Trips by Weekday per Hour]()
Most of the users use bikes early in the morning and in the evening. It can be concluded that they are mostly being used to commute to work as there is a lot of usage Monday - Friday. 

![Trips by Gender]()
Males use the bikes the most. There isn't much usage of bikes in the evening on Wednesdays. 

![User Trips by Gender by Weekday]()
Males subscribers use bikes the most on Thursdays. Heavy usage on Monday, Tuesday  and Friday. 

![Top Starting Locations]()
Map showing the Top Starting Locations.

![Top Ending Locations]()
Map showing the Top Ending Locations.

## Summary

there is a large market for bikesharing among the male population. Other visualizations that could be used are non-subscribers checkout times and usage based off age.
